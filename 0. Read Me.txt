Proteus Stepper Motor is 4 pole Stepper Motor.
But Hardware Stepper Motor we used is Micro-Stepper Motor.

So, to observe the output in Proteus, Select 'STEPPER_MOTOR_Software.Hex' file
& to observe the output in Hardware, Select 'STEPPER_MOTOR_Hardware.Hex' file.

Hardware Code output is shown in the video. Software & Hardware code are different.
